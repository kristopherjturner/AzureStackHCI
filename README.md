# AzureStackHCI
My attempts at creating various scripts for deploying and managing Azure Stack HCI. Also a place to hold my work so I won't lose it.

This repo will one day have scripts that will cover:

- Deployment of Azure Stack HCI Cluster
  - Single-Node Deployments
  - Multi-Node Deployments
  - Deployment on Virtual Machines
  - Deployment on Physical Machines
- Management of Azure Stack HCI
- Azure Services Deployment

and more as I go.

Currently, my plans are to focus on PowerShell first. However I do plan to try and develop and/or collect various scripts from other tools like Bicep, ARM Templates, and even Terraform.
